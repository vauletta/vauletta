- 👋 Hi, I’m @vauletta
- 👀 I'm interested in microprocessors and microcontrollers. I was a PL/M 80 programmer from 1985 to 1989 for a proprietary Fuel Oil Truck Transaction Computer. I was a PL/M 51 programmer from 1987 to 1989 for a proprietary CardKey access system. I used CP/M on x80 based equipment till 1989. I used PCDOS 3.3 thru MS-DOS 6.2 and Windows 3.1 to my current OS, Windows 11. I developed a SCO/Unix device driver for a propriety ISA based SCSI controller to interface with a variety of tape devices including both TEAC and Exabyte tape drives in the early 1990’s. From 2012 to 2018 I developed and maintained several high availability failover clusters for manufacturing corporations for local server datacenters. Fuctionality included E-Mail, SQL, File and Print services and Client management. Due to illness, I have been absent from both my love of electronics and computers as well as my hobbies of model railroading and reading. It has been 25 months since my heart transplant surgery and the associated reduction in medications that I find my head is clear enough to resume exploring and learning more again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about ESP32 and experimenting with IoT and DMX512 to realize something I've been visualizing for over 30 years in my dreams
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment as I'm novice at the moment and struggling to compile and make viaable programs for the ESP32 microcontroller.
